# ==========================================================================
# clusters/aicr.sh -- AICR (docs.aicr.ai), b200-devel partition
#
# Nodes are 128-core EPYC 9745 / 1.125 TB RAM with 8 GPUs, so 16 cores +
# 64 GB is roughly the per-GPU share. AICR's default memory is only 1 GB per
# CPU, so --mem is mandatory. GPUs are requested with --gpus; --gres is not
# used here, and the partition (not a type string) selects the hardware.
#
# THIS PROFILE IS THE DEVEL PARTITION: 4 h cap, max 4 concurrent jobs per
# user. For the 24 h production partition use the sibling profile instead of
# editing this file:
#
#     CLUSTER=aicr-batch ./submit.sh config.toml
#     CLUSTER=aicr-batch ./submit_branch.sh --from <dir> --run N --extra M
#
# The partition is chosen PER SUBMISSION that way, and it sticks: submit.sh
# records $CLUSTER_NAME in <sweep>/cluster.txt, and run.sh loads that same
# profile on every self-resubmission, so a sweep never drifts between
# partitions mid-flight. An environment variable read inside this file could
# not do that -- only the profile NAME is persisted.
#
# Both profiles are built by aicr_profile below, so the account, memory, core
# count and module live in exactly one place.
#
# MAX_RUNTIME_MIN in config.toml is the other half of the walltime pairing: it
# is what stops the run gracefully and writes the checkpoint, so if it exceeds
# --time then Slurm hard-kills the job first. submit.sh enforces that, and
# also warns when it is far BELOW the walltime (the "submitted a 24 h job that
# stops itself after 4 h" case).
